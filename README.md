This project utilizes Node.js, React, MobX, session-based authentication, and Azure File Service (but not Azure Blob Service). For expediency, the server code was adapted and extended from the project for <a title="Mike.Works" href="https://mike.works">Mike Works'</a> <a title="Web Security for Web Developers" href="https://mike.works/course/web-security-5c876cc">Web Security for Web Developers</a> course, while the client-side code was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and further extended with the incomplete <a href="https://github.com/qq52184962/react-file-browser">react-file-browser</a> project, which was completed and polished for this application.
